# Original Project Prompt

## Objective
Build a rope and pulley system simulator.

## Requirements
The simulator should allow users to:
- Sketch ropes
- Sketch pulleys
- Sketch grounds (anchors)
- Sketch weights (masses)
- Simulate their interactions

## Goal
Create an interactive tool that visually represents the physics of rope and pulley systems, allowing users to design systems and analyze the forces and mechanical advantage.
